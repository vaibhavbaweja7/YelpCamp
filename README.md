YelpCamp is a web application that allows users to register and then login to book a camp and also to rate and review it. 
It acts as digital voting portal, with simple user interface for ease of use and facility to book camps, give rating and reviews and also add new campgrounds and edit existing campgrounds.  
I have deployed the app on heroku and can be acccessed at - https://weyelpcamp.herokuapp.com
I have completed this project in a code along with The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 by Colt Steele.
